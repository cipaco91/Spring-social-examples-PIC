Spring Social Showcase
======================
This sample app demonstrates many of the capabilities of the Spring Social project, including:
* Connect to Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn
* Sign in using Facebook, Twitter, and Linked in using ProviderSignInController for provider-signin

To run, simply import the project into your IDE and deploy to a Servlet 2.5 or > container such as Tomcat 6 or 7.
Access the project at http://localhost:8080/spring-social-showcase

Alternatively, you can run the application using Gradle. 

To make it easier to build the project with Gradle, the Gradle wrapper has been included. The Gradle wrapper makes it possible to run Gradle without having to explicitly install Gradle to your system.

To run the application with Gradle:

```sh
$ gradlew tomcatRun
```
